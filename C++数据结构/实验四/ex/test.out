Mylove is a taecher at a school in a big city in England .He usually goes to France or Canada for a few days during his summer holiday and he speaks French very well .
One year Mylove said to one of his friend ,¡± I¡¯m going to have a holiday in Japan .But I can¡¯t speak Japanese ,so I am going to have evening classes for Japanese lessons for a month before I go .¡°
He studied very hard for a month, and then he went to Japan.
When he came back a few weeks later, his friend said to him,¡±Did you have any trouble with your Japanese when you were in Japan ?¡±
¡°No,I didn¡¯t have any trouble with it,¡±answered Mylove 
¡°But the Japanese did!¡±
